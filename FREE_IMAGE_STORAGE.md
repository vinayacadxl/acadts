# Free Image Storage Solution

## ✅ Completely Free - No Upgrade Needed!

The app now uses **Base64 image storage** which is **100% free** and requires **no Firebase Storage plan upgrade**.

## How It Works

Images are stored as **base64 strings directly in Firestore documents**. This means:
- ✅ **No Storage plan needed** - Works with free Spark plan
- ✅ **No upgrade required** - Completely free forever
- ✅ **No billing setup** - No credit card needed
- ✅ **Simple and reliable** - Images stored with question data

## Image Size Limit

- **Maximum size: 500KB per image**
- This is due to Firestore document size limits (1MB per document)
- Most question images can be compressed to under 500KB easily

## How to Compress Images

### Option 1: TinyPNG (Recommended)
1. Go to [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com)
2. Upload your image
3. Download the compressed version
4. Upload to your app

### Option 2: Squoosh (Google)
1. Go to [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app)
2. Upload your image
3. Adjust quality/size
4. Download and upload to app

### Option 3: Built-in Tools
- **Windows**: Use Paint 3D or Photos app to resize
- **Mac**: Use Preview to resize and compress
- **Online**: Use any image compression tool

## Tips for Best Results

1. **For diagrams/text images**: PNG format works best
2. **For photos**: JPEG with 70-80% quality is usually enough
3. **Resize large images**: Most question images don't need to be 4K resolution
4. **Remove unnecessary metadata**: Compression tools do this automatically

## Technical Details

- Images are stored as `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` strings in Firestore
- No separate storage service needed
- Images load instantly (no CDN delay)
- Works offline (images cached in Firestore)

## Future Upgrade Path

If you need larger images later, you can:
1. Enable Firebase Storage (Blaze plan - still has free tier)
2. The code will automatically use Storage if configured
3. No code changes needed - just update the config

But for now, **base64 storage is perfect and completely free!** 🎉
